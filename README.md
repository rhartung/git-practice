# A git playground
To get more comfortable using git, I needed a place to practice commands without accidentally jacking up people's code bases.  Welcome to the git playground.

## Code snippets
I've added sample files containing simple code snippets to play with and commit to git.  Feel free to clone, fork, & branch this repo, and add in come code samples of your own.
